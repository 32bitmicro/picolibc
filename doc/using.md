# Using Picolibc in Embedded Systems

Picolibc is designed to be used in deeply embedded systems, those
running either no operating system or a small RTOS. It is designed to
be linked statically along with any operating system and application
code.

## Compiling with Picolibc

To compile source code to use Picolibc, you can use the GCC .specs
file delivered with Picolibc. This will set the system header file
path and the linker library path to point at Picolibc. For example, to
compile a single file and generate a .o file:

	$ gcc -specs=picolibc.specs -c foo.c

When installed directly into the system, picolibc.specs is placed in
the gcc directory so that it will be found using just the base name of
the file. If installed in a separate location, you will need to provide an
absolute pathname to the picolibc.specs file.

When building for an embedded system, you'll probably need to use a
longer name for the compiler, something like `riscv-unknown-elf-gcc`
or `arm-none-eabi-gcc`.

## Picolibc startup

Initializing an embedded system usually requires a combination of
hardware, run-time, library and application setup. You may want to
perform all of these in your own code, or you be able to use the
Picolibc startup code. Either works fine, using the Picolibc code
means writing less of your own.

### Picocrt â€” Picolibc startup code

Picocrt is the crt0.o code provided by Picolibc. This is enabled by
default when using -specs=picolibc.specs:

	$ gcc -specs=picolibc.specs -o foo.elf foo.c

Picocrt goes through a sequence of initialization steps, many of which
you can plug your own code into:

 1) Architecture-specific runtime initialization. For instance, RISC-V
    needs the `gp` register initialized for quick access to global
    variables while ARM with hardware floating point needs to have the
    FPSCR register set up to match C semantics for rounding.
    
 2) Data initialization. Here's the code inside Picocrt:
```
memcpy(__data_start, __data_source, (uintptr_t) __data_size);
```
For this to work, the linker script must assign correct values to
each of these symbols:

 * __data_start points to the RAM location where the .data segment
   starts.
 * __data_source points to the Flash location where the .data segment
   initialization values are stored.
 * __data_size is an absolute symbol noting the size of the
   initialized data segment

 3) BSS initialization. Here's the code inside Picocrt:
```
memset(__bss_start, '\0', (uintptr_t) __bss_size);
```
Assign these symbols in the linker script as follows:

 * __bss_start points to the RAM location where the .bss segment
   starts.
 * __bss_size is an absolute symbol noting the size of the cleared
   data segment

 4) Call [initializers/constructors](init) using `__libc_init_array()`

 5) Call `main()`

 6) Call [finalizers/destructors](fini) using `__libc_fini_array()`
