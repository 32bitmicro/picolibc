# PicoLibc
Copyright Â© 2018,2019 Keith Packard

PicoLibc is library offering standard C library APIs that targets
small embedded systems with limited RAM. PicoLibc was formed by blending
code from [Newlib](http://sourceware.org/newlib/) and
[AVR Libc](https://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/).

## License

Picolibc source comes from a variety of places and has a huge variety
of copyright holders and license texts. While much of the code comes
from newlib, none of the GPL-related bits are left in the repository,
so all of the source code uses BSD-like licenses, a mixture of 2- and
3- clause BSD itself and a variety of other (mostly older) licenses
with similar terms.
